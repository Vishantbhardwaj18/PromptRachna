          <img src="v2.jpg" alt="Slide 1">
          <p class="slide-text">1. The Quiet Boy-Ren, 10, sits cross-legged by a window, his small fingers deftly folding paper stars from pastel-colored strips. The soft rustle of paper is the only sound in the quiet room. Outside, the world moves, but inside, everything is still. He lives with his grandmother, Aya, in a cozy, modest house filled with plants and old memories. His silence is a constant companion, yet his eyes observe everything.</p>
        </div>

          <img src="v3.jpg" alt="Slide 2">
          <p class="slide-text">2. Missing Pieces-In a flashback, a rain-soaked road. Headlights. Screeching tires.
            Back in the present, Ren’s eyes glaze over an old family photo. Aya, now gray-haired and gentle, watches him from the kitchen doorway. Her heart aches with love and helplessness. Ren hasn't spoken since the accident two years ago.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Slide 3 -->
        <div class="slide">
          <img src="v4.jpg" alt="Slide 3">
          <p class="slide-text">3. A New Classmate - At school, Ren sits alone, folding another star. Enter Hana—a new girl with a ponytail and a contagious smile. She plops down beside him and introduces herself with a cheerful “Hi!” Ren looks at her, expression blank, then continues folding. She frowns, puzzled, but not discouraged.</p>

        <div class="slide">
          <img src="v5.jpg" alt="Slide 4">
          <p class="slide-text">4. The Bully
            A larger boy, Kenta, strides by and knocks over Ren’s glass jar of stars. The tiny papers scatter across the floor like fallen petals. Ren freezes. Before a teacher can intervene, Hana kneels and helps pick them up. When they finish, Ren silently holds out a star to her—bright yellow. Her eyes widen, and she smiles again.

          <p class="slide-text">5. The Garden
            At home, Ren and Aya tend to their garden. Aya gently pulls weeds while Ren waters flowers. She pauses and says, “Each flower you care for returns your love in silence.” Ren watches a butterfly land on a sunflower and quietly nods.</p>

          <p class="slide-text">6. Hana’s Curiosity
            Intrigued by Ren’s stars, Hana checks out books from the library. She finds the legend of the thousand paper cranes and discovers a variation: a thousand stars can carry a wish to the heavens. Inspired, she begins folding too—clumsy at first, but determined.

            One afternoon, she struggles with a particularly stubborn fold. Ren notices. He gently reaches over, takes the strip, and shows her the technique. As she tries again, Ren watches. A shy, nearly invisible smile lifts the corner of his mouth. Hana gasps. “I saw that!”</p>

            Aya begins coughing more frequently. She brushes it off with a wave of her hand, but we see her later taking medication when Ren isn't looking. She reads a letter beside her bed—one she has yet to give him.

            During the town’s lantern festival, children release floating lanterns. Ren walks quietly beside Hana, his fingers curled tightly around a single star. He spots a lantern drifting upward with his parents’ names on it. His eyes shimmer with tears. One rolls down silently.</p>

            At school, a sudden gust of wind blows Ren’s jar of stars off the windowsill. They scatter across the field. Ren sprints after them, heart pounding. Hana catches up to find him on the ground, trembling, tears finally flowing. She hugs him tightly. He doesn't pull away.

            The next day, Ren hands Hana a small, neatly folded note. Inside:
            "Help me fold 1,000 stars—for Grandma.”
            Hana looks at him, stunned. Then smiles, with tears in her eyes. “Let’s do it.”</p>

            Ren rummages through a cabinet and finds an old photo album tucked in a drawer. Photos of his young parents, Aya in her youth, smiling with her husband. In the back, a note: “Life is not lost—it changes form.”

            Aya collapses one morning. She’s taken to the hospital. The doctor tells Ren her heart condition has worsened. She may not have much time. The silence in Ren’s world deepens, but determination rises behind his eyes.

            Ren folds stars day and night. Hana rallies classmates. One by one, they join in. Desks are covered in paper strips. The classroom becomes a quiet chorus of whispered wishes and rustling folds. Teachers glance on, moved but speechless.

            Ren walks into her hospital room, holding a large glass jar filled with 1,000 stars. He sets it gently on the table beside her. Aya looks at it, and then at him. Her eyes fill with tears. She reaches out, brushing his cheek. “They’re beautiful…”

    <h2>Moral</h2>
    <p>💫 Moral:
        Healing takes time, but kindness, patience, and love <br> —no matter how small <br> —can guide someone out of the darkest silence. <br> </p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <Summary>Ren, a quiet 10-year-old boy, lives with his gentle grandmother Aya in a modest house filled with plants and memories. Ever since a tragic accident two years ago, Ren hasn’t spoken, finding comfort in folding colorful paper stars in silence.
        
        At school, Ren meets Hana, a bright and curious new classmate who refuses to be discouraged by his silence. Their bond begins to grow when she helps him after a bully scatters his jar of stars. Fascinated by his origami, Hana learns about the legend of 1,000 paper stars and joins Ren in folding them—at first awkwardly, but with growing determination.
        
        As their friendship blossoms, Ren begins to open up, even offering his first shy smile. But Aya's health quietly declines, revealed in private moments and a hidden letter she keeps by her bedside. When Aya collapses, Ren is overwhelmed but channels his love into a mission—to fold 1,000 stars for her, with Hana and his classmates rallying behind him.
        
        In a deeply emotional moment, Ren presents the completed jar of stars to Aya in the hospital. When she sees them, Ren finally speaks: “Don’t go yet.” Aya passes peacefully that night, her hand resting near the stars.
        
        After her death, Ren discovers a heartfelt letter from Aya, encouraging him to find strength in his voice and continue spreading light. In her honor, Ren and his classmates create a garden full of sunflowers—Aya’s favorite—and at the school’s spring festival, stars decorate the trees and lanterns.
        
        Ren steps onto the stage, voice steady, and says:  
        “Sometimes, the quietest people love the loudest.”
        
        The story closes on a note of healing, hope, and quiet courage, as Ren begins to speak not just for himself, but for others still finding their voice.</Summary></h2>
